## Thursday, June 27th 
Location: SUSTech, Department of Physics, Office 506

- Write a generator of EPR pairs (Bell State) with ProjectQ
- Visualize the quatum circuit with ProjectQ Circuit Drawer, generate tex file and compile it to pdf using pdflatex
- Take a trail of IBM Q Experience (as Backend)
 
### Question
What's the purpose or usage of `meta` part in the `ProjectQ` library? 

## Friday, June 28th 
Location: SUSTech, Department of Physics, Office 506

- Write a circuit for quantum teleportation, visualize with drawer
- Read the docs of ProjectQ Meta part
- Set development environment, use MinGW and vcruntime140.dll to compile ProjectQ C++ engine (higher efficiency)
- Read the demo code for Grover's Algorithm in ProjectQ decumentation, check the details and review the techniques used in the exemplary implementation
